# TinderBox API
This is the API for the TinderBox arcade system.  For information and discussion on the TinderBox, please visit https://www.progfrog.co/projects/34/log (coming soon - instructions for uploading your game and getting your Game ID).

## Workflow ##
1. When a player chooses your game, our launcher will run your game's executable in a background process.
1. Once your game has loaded its assets and is ready to play, it should send a **game_ready** command to the launcher (see below).
1. The launcher will present your game fullscreen at 1920x1080 resolution.
1. After the player has completed a game and is out of continues (or lets your "continue playing?" timer run out), your game should send a **game_ended** command to bring the launcher back to the front.

## Installation (for Unity)
1. Import the TinderBoxAPI.unitypackage file into your Unity project.
1. Add the TinderBoxObject prefab to your scene.
1. In the TinderBoxObject inspector, set the **Game ID** field to your game's assigned ID.
1. In your game's Player Settings, set "Display Resolution Dialog" to "Hidden By Default".

## Usage (for Unity)
1. Add `using TinderBox;` to your using statements in any files you want to access the API from.
2. Observe the workflow at the top of this page, using the API commands `TinderBoxAPI.IsReady()` and `TinderBoxAPI.GameOver()`.
3. Use `TinderBoxAPI.ControlState()`, `TinderBoxAPI.ControlUp()`, and `TinderBoxAPI.ControlDown()` to find the status of the arcade controls.  You will need to provide the player ID and the control name, listed below: 
```c#

    public enum Players
    {
        Player1,
        Player2,
        Player3,
        Player4
    }

    public enum Controls
    {
        Up,
        Down,
        Left,
        Right,
        Button1,
        Button2,
        Button3,
        Button4,
        Button5
    }
```

## Usage (non-Unity)
1. To give the launcher a command, send an HTTP GET request to: http://localhost/api/{command}?game_id={your-game-id}
1. Observe the workflow at the top of this page, using the API commands **game_ready** and **game_ended**.
1. Map your controls to a receive keyboard inputs.  Use these mappings:
